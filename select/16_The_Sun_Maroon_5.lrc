[00:19.50] After school, walkin' home
[00:21.87] Fresh dirt under my fingernails and
[00:25.16] I can smell hot asphalt
[00:28.17] Cars screech to a halt to let me pass
[00:31.17] And I cannot remember
[00:33.53] What life was like through photographs
[00:37.10] And trying to recreate images
[00:41.53] Life gives us from our past
[00:44.50] And sometimes it's a sad song
[00:59.00] 
[00:47.82] But I
[00:49.53] Cannot forget, refuse to regret
[00:51.84] So glad I met you and
[00:55.14] Take my breath away, make everyday
[00:57.81] Worth all of the pain that I've gone through
[01:00.86] And mama, I've been cryin'
[01:03.68] 'Cause things ain't how they used to be
[01:06.16] She said, the battle's almost won
[01:09.29] And we're only several miles from the sun
[01:15.57] Woah, yeah
[01:20.57] 
[01:24.95] And I'm movin' on down my street
[01:27.98] I see people I won't ever meet
[01:30.94] I think of her, take a breath
[01:33.82] Feel the beat in the rhythm of my steps
[01:37.62] And sometimes it's a sad song
[01:52.12] 
[01:42.28] Oh, but I
[01:43.27] Cannot forget, refuse to regret
[01:45.64] So glad I met you and
[01:49.36] Take my breath away, make everyday
[01:52.25] Worth all of the pain that I've gone through
[01:55.24] And mama, I've been cryin'
[01:57.70] 'Cause things ain't how they used to be
[02:00.36] She said, the battle's almost won
[02:03.71] And we're only several miles from the sun
[02:24.21] 
[02:07.37] The rhythm of the conversation
[02:10.03] The perfection of her creation
[02:12.78] The sex she slipped into my coffee
[02:15.71] The way she felt when she first saw me
[02:18.34] Yeah, hate to love and love to hate her
[02:21.72] Like a broken record player, yeah
[02:24.72] Back and forth and here and gone
[02:27.36] And on and on and on and on
[02:40.86] 
[02:31.47] I cannot forget, refuse to regret
[02:34.05] So glad I met you and
[02:37.01] Take my breath away, make everyday
[02:40.07] Worth all of the pain that I've gone through
[02:43.12] And mama, I've been cryin'
[02:45.39] 'Cause things ain't how they used to be
[02:48.03] She said, the battle's almost won
[02:51.02] And we're only several miles from the sun
[03:11.52] 
[03:24.17] I cannot forget, refuse to regret
[03:25.99] So glad I met you and
[03:26.50] Take my breath away, make everyday
[03:26.81] Worth all of the pain that I've gone through
[03:27.52] And mama, I've been cryin'
[03:28.12] 'Cause things ain't how they used to be
[03:28.80] She said, the battle's almost won
[03:29.49] And we're only several miles
[03:43.49] 
[03:30.16] Say my battle's almost won
[03:30.96] And we're only several miles from the sun, yeah
[03:31.84] Oh, several miles from the sun, oh
[03:32.41] Yeah, yeah yeah
[03:32.87] Woo, woah, woah, yeah!
